                            <figcaption> "Dolly is pictured with her husband, Carl Dean. The two met in 1964 outside a laundromat on the first day Dolly Parton arrived to Nashville. Dolly's music career was taking off, and despite pressure from her record company to hold off on marrying, Dolly and Carl eloped in '66. She has said "I was so in love with Carl I couldnâ€™t see straight," and was determined to tie the knot.  Despite Carl rarely being seen with Dolly in public, he is featured on the cover of her song, "Blue Ridge Mountain Boy". The two celebrated their golden (50th) anniversary in 2016. In 2011, Parton said, "We're really very proud of our marriage. It's the first for both of us. And the last." </figcaption>

                            <figcaption> In this photo taken in 1969, Dolly and Porter Wagoner stand on the set of The Porter Wagoner Show. Dolly accepted Porter Wagoner's invitation to join the Porter Wagoner show two years prior in 1967. The two shared a close but tumultuous relationship. They recorded several albums together, and had a good deal of commercial success before Dolly ultimately decided to part with Porter and his show in 1974 after struggling to negotiate with Porter over her ability to make some music independently. Dolly has said that her 1974 song "I Will Always Love You" is about Porter Wagoner.</figcaption>

Never belonged in my whole life, even as a little kid. I was just different and so I never really found my place till I moved to Nashville and got in the music business. That was my real place, so I fit in." </figcaption>

Dolly opened Dollywood in 1986 in her native East Tennessee because she "always thought that if I made it big or got successful at what I had started out to do, that I wanted to come back to my part of the country and do something great, something that would bring a lot of jobs into this area." </figcaption>

                            <figcaption> This photo captures Dolly Parton's Stampede. She opened the dinner theater attraction in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in 1987 under the original name of "Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede". The premise is loosely based on the civil war wherein one sequined group on horseback is portrayed is the Union and the other as the Confederacy. It depicts the Civil War as a romanticized way, as a friendly rivalry. In 2017, Dolly decided to drop the "Dixie" amid growing controversy about the name in the wake of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va and similar events.</figcaption>

"I understand people having to make themselves known and felt and seen," she told the magazine. "And of course Black lives matter. Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!"</figcaption>

She was thrilled to find out around the same time the rest of the country did that her donation had went to partially fund the Moderna vaccine.
