                <h2>Coat of Many Colors, 1968</h2>
                <p  class="coatOne">Back through the years</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">I go wonderin' once again</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Back to the seasons of my youth</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">I recall a box of rags that someone gave us</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">And how my momma put the rags to use</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">There were rags of many colors</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Every piece was small</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">And I didn't have a coat</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">And it was way down in the fall</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Momma sewed the rags together</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Sewin' every piece with love</p>
                <p class="coatOne">She made my coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">That I was so proud of</p>
                <p>As she sewed, she told a story</p>
                <p>From the Bible, she had read</p>
                <p>About a coat of many colors</p>
                <p>Joseph wore and then she said</p>
                <p>Perhaps this coat will bring you</p>
                <p>Good luck and happiness</p>
                <p>And I just couldn't wait to wear it</p>
                <p>And momma blessed it with a kiss</p>
                <p>My coat of many colors</p>
                <p>That my momma made for me</p>
                <p>Made only from rags</p>
                <p>But I wore it so proudly</p>
                <p>Although we had no money</p>
                <p>I was rich as I could be</p>
                <p>In my coat of many colors</p>
                <p>My momma made for me</p>
                <p>So with patches on my britches</p>
                <p>And holes in both my shoes</p>
                <p>In my coat of many colors</p>
                <p>I hurried off to school</p>
                <p>Just to find the others laughing
                <p>And making fun of me</p>
                <p>In my coat of many colors</p>
                <p>My momma made for me</p>
                <p>And oh, I couldn't understand it</p>
                    <p>For I felt I was rich</p>
                    <p>And I told 'em of the love</p>
                    <p>My momma sewed in every stitch</p>
                    <p>And I told 'em all the story</p>
                    <p>Momma told me while she sewed</p>
                    <p>And how my coat of many colors</p>
                    <p>Was worth more than all their clothes</p>
                    <p>But they didn't understand it</p>
                    <p>And I tried to make them see</p>
                    <p>That one is only poor</p>
                    <p>Only if they choose to be</p>
                    <p>Now I know we had no money</p>
                    <p>But I was rich as I could be</p>
                    <p>In my coat of many colors</p>
                    <p>My momma made for me</p>
                    <p>Made just for me</p>
