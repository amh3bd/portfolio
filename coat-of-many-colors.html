                <h2>Coat of Many Colors, 1968</h2>
                <p  class="coatOne">Back through the years</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">I go wonderin' once again</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Back to the seasons of my youth</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">I recall a box of rags that someone gave us</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">And how my momma put the rags to use</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">There were rags of many colors</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Every piece was small</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">And I didn't have a coat</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">And it was way down in the fall</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Momma sewed the rags together</p>
                <p  class="coatOne">Sewin' every piece with love</p>
                <p class="coatOne">She made my coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">That I was so proud of</p>
                <p class="coatOne">As she sewed, she told a story</p>
                <p class="coatOne">From the Bible, she had read</p>
                <p class="coatOne">About a coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Joseph wore and then she said</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Perhaps this coat will bring you</p>
                <p class="coatOne"> Good luck and happiness</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And I just couldn't wait to wear it</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And momma blessed it with a kiss</p>
                <p class="coatOne">My coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">That my momma made for me</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Made only from rags</p>
                <p class="coatOne">But I wore it so proudly</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Although we had no money</p>
                <p class="coatOne">I was rich as I could be</p>
                <p class="coatOne">In my coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">My momma made for me</p>
                <p class="coatOne">So with patches on my britches</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And holes in both my shoes</p>
                <p class="coatOne">In my coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">I hurried off to school</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Just to find the others laughing
                <p class="coatOne">And making fun of me</p>
                <p class="coatOne">In my coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">My momma made for me</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And oh, I couldn't understand it</p>
                <p class="coatOne">For I felt I was rich</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And I told 'em of the love</p>
                <p class="coatOne">My momma sewed in every stitch</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And I told 'em all the story</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Momma told me while she sewed</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And how my coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Was worth more than all their clothes</p>
                <p class="coatOne">But they didn't understand it</p>
                <p class="coatOne">And I tried to make them see</p>
                <p class="coatOne">That one is only poor</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Only if they choose to be</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Now I know we had no money</p>
                <p class="coatOne">But I was rich as I could be</p>
                <p class="coatOne">In my coat of many colors</p>
                <p class="coatOne">My momma made for me</p>
                <p class="coatOne">Made just for me</p>
